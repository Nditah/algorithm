/* Letâ€™s say, we are required to write a function that returns the index of the very first element that appears at least twice in the array. If no element appears more than once, we have to return -1. We have to do this in constant space (i.e., without utilizing extra memory).

Therefore, let's write the solution for this problem. We will use a for loop to iterate over the array and use the Array.prototype.lastIndexOf() method to check for duplicacy.
